          This is the home page after logging in. It&apos;s kinda empty right now,
          but believe me, it&apos;s gonna have some stuff. Eventually.

          Like, imagine a character right here.
        </p>
        <p>
          Or heck, multiple.

          That would be incredible. Sadly I am wasting my time making stupid comments instead of coding.
        </p>
        <p>I kinda like putting off the coding.</p>
        <p>This has just turned into a stream of conciousness.</p>
        <p>Like, why have prices on eggs gone up so much lately? Crazy.</p>
        <p>Or the fact that a project I really liked, Blinks by Move38, is halting production.</p>
        <p>That&apos;s a real bummer.</p>
        <p>I am still putting off coding.</p>
